***We will implement a simple travel provider app that can be used to manage flight bookings. A single travel should be  booked by the travel provider for an existing customer through a travel agency and include one or multiple flight bookings.***


In this case you can see the customer one is the travel provider and travel agency. we will plan a trip and book for customer through travel provider in real time like<ins> makemytrip</ins> and travel agency such as airasia andn indigo .

*They entered the booking detail , supplementry detail what the customer wants after the process they will save in the back end and approved by the travel agency .*

Two different views of the travel app.


1.Processor :- creates individual travel instances, creates and manages individual flights and adds supplements to flight bookings.

2.Approver :- Verfication of the recorded travel data entered by the processor.

_/DMO/Travel is the root entity.There can be n number of bookings and n number of supplements I need some extra services like particular food in flight. 
_It is the composition relationship between the travel , the booking and the supplement entries where the travel entity represents roots of the data model.
